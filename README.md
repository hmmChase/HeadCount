# HeadCount 2.0

The point of this project was to take static data files and, using React, display the data to the page. We made each dataset into cards, which can then be clicked on to compare two datasets. Using Jest and Enzyme, we built a test suite for the application. This project was built using the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) boilerplate.
